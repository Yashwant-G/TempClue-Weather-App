## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/MMB9PGr/Screenshot-2023-04-02-224906.png)

The website is a robust and fully-featured web application developed by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming, which also uses asynchronous programming techniques. The website incorporates several APIs to provide real-time weather information, news, and time data to users. It is designed with a responsive layout, making it easy to use on various screen sizes and devices.

The website's main features are:-
* Fetch current location weather
* Search for weather information in any city
* Display weather news for a user's desired location
* Show live-time information for that location. 

The website utilizes multiple APIs such as OpenWeatherMap API, TimezoneDB API, and Google Custom Search Engine API to provide users with accurate and relevant information. Additionally, the website includes a dynamic background that changes according to the sky condition, and it has a loading feature with the background fading for a better user experience. This website also includes the implementation of Web Search API to speak the weather stats.
